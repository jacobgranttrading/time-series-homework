## Conclusions

### My overall conclusion after building these models is that they are not accurate enough for me to use them to trade

Time Series Analysis Conclusions
1. Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now? I would not buy the yen now.
2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease? The risk is expected to increase.
3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading? I would not feel confident using the models for trading because the model evaluation resulted in high AIC and BIC scores as well as P values that were often greater than .05%

Regression Analysis Conclusions
1. Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data? The model performs worse on out of sample data which is to be expected.
